 Global Happiness Modeling & Analysis
 
 Overview:
 
This project explores what drives global happiness by analyzing lifestyle, environmental, and economic factors across major cities. Using multiple regression and ensemble learning models, it identifies the strongest predictors of happiness and evaluates their performance.

Project Files:

Global_Happiness_Report.pdf — Detailed analysis report with visualizations, methodology, and insights.
healthy_lifestyle_analysis.py — Python code for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.

Key Results:

Top Predictors: Cost of water, life expectancy, and pollution index.
Best Models: Ridge Regression (R² = 0.935) and Random Forest (R² = 0.927).

Core Insight: Economic affordability, environmental quality, and longevity have a greater impact on happiness than work or lifestyle metric

Tools & Techniques:

Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn
Models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR

Summary:

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of predictive modeling , from data preprocessing and visualization to model evaluation. The insights can support data-driven policymaking aimed at improving well-being across nations.
